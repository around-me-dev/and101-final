## Summary

This document provides an overview, project spec, and wireframes for our team's capstone project: A local events app that allows users to view their position on a GPS map, like google maps, and nearby events that are happening or may start in the future will be populated throughout the map. The events will show how a description of what the event is, the time, where it is, and how far from your current location.

If we had to describe this milestone in three (3) emojis, they would be: 😱🐛🤘
